.DESCRIPTION
This applet converts .DAT files in a .zip file to .WIBL files in a directory that matches the source .zip.

.OUTPUTS
A directory structure containing .WIBL files matching the input .zip file

.INPUTS
A .zip file containing subdirectories of .DAT files

.NOTES
The -verbose flag will show you some more information of what's happening behind the scenes.
The -debug flag will tell you about each file as they're getting converted

This script is multithreaded, and therefore requires at least Powershell 7.0.0
This was developed using Powershell 7.3.4

.PARAMETER Source
The source .ZIP file to extract the .DAT files from

.PARAMETER LogConvertPath
The location of logconvert.exe, if it isn't in a folder next to the script called "logconvert"

.PARAMETER OutputFolder
A folder to output all of the processed files to. This folder will have the same structure as the
source zip folder

.EXAMPLE
PS > ./Convert-DATToWIBL.ps1 input.zip output

.EXAMPLE
PS > ./Convert-DATToWIBL.ps1 -Source input.zip -OutputFolder C:\foo\bar\baz

.EXAMPLE
PS > ./Convert-DATToWIBL -Source input.zip -OutputFolder C:\foo\bar\baz -LogConvertPath C:\foo\bar\logconvert.exe

.EXAMPLE
PS > ./Convert-DATToWIBL -Source input.zip -OutputFolder C:\foo\bar\baz -LogConvertPath C:\foo\bar\logconvert.exe
