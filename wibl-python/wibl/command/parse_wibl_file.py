# \brief Parse a WIBL file and report the contents (for debugging, mainly)
#
# This is a simple command-line utility that will read the contents of a WIBL binary
# file using the same code that the cloud-based processing uses, thereby confirming that
# the file will be parseable in the cloud.  This also allows for various debugging and
# investigation actions.
