# Application global variables needed to bring up the whole app, and the database
#
# In the Flask environment, it is expected that the app variable is a global, and the
# SQLAlchemy instance variable has to be constructed before the data models can be
# specified (since they need an embedded type from the instance of the database).  This
# file provides these two variables so that they can be imported into other modules.
