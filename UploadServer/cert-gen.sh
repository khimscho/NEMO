# This generates a set of certificates for self-signing, which can be used for testing the logger on the
# local network.  These should not, obviously, be used in production over the open internet!  The IP address
# of the test server connected to the logger's WiFi is almost always 192.168.4.2 (the logger is always
# 192.168.4.1 when booted as an AP), which is assumed in the CA and server setup below.  You may have to adjust
# for your particular test environment.  You should obviously also change the SUBJECT_* variable descriptions.
#
# Typically, you'd want to make the certificates in ./certs (the Go code also assumes that it'll find them
# there).  Note that you need to upload ca.cert to the logger to allow for TLS to work, but the upload
# mechanism assumes something that will be *.txt; you can simply copy ca.cert to ca-cert.txt for this.
#
# The source for this came from a GitHub issue report (https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues/6060),
# so attribution is unknown (apart from the username, which leads to https://github.com/potatcode).  We'd like
# to thank the contributor for providing the clues on how to generate the certificates required for this
# correctly.
#
# As a consequence of the unknown status of this script, this file has no license information.  We'd assume that
# it's effectively public domain, or at least open source, but have no evidence to that effect.
