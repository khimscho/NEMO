 * @brief Demonstration upload server for WIBL loggers with auto-upload enabled.
 *
 * Although it is generally the case that WIBL loggers run without internet connection (most
 * small boats of opportunity don't have always-on connectivity), there are some use cases where
 * connectivity may be available, and the logger can upload files automatically to a server
 * (at which point it can be proxied into the S3 bucket for processing).  This code provides
 * the minimal core functionality for the server side of the protocol (the client side is in the
 * logger firmware) as a demonstration of what's required for an industrial-grade server
 * implementation.
 *
 * The code for TLS support and BasicAuth is heavily based on the information provided by Alex
 * Edwards here https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/basic-authentication-in-go.  That code has an MIT
 * license, which is the same as that used for the rest of the project, so it's included below.

Wibl-monitor demonstrates the server end of the WIBL logger upload protocol.
The code generates an HTTP server with two end-points:
  - checkin, which is used by loggers to report status information (and check the server is accessible)
  - update, which is used by loggers to transfer files for processing

Usage:

	wibl-monitor [flags]

The flags are:

	-config
		Specify a JSON format file to configure the server

Without flags, the code generates a default configuration for the server, typically
bringing it up on a non-constrained port (see support/config.go for details).
