 * \brief Abstract interface to start the memory system used for log files
 *
 * Depending on the configuration of the logger, the code can write to either an SD card
 * using the SPI interface, or to an eMMC chip using the SDIO/MMC interface.  This object
 * starts the right Arduino interface components for the appropriate system so the main
 * code doesn't have to work this out.
